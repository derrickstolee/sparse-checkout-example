# Sparse-Checkout Example Repo

This repository is an example of a file layout that works
well with the sparse-checkout file.

## git sparse-checkout commands

You can run the `bootstrap.sh` command using one of the
following teams: `android`, `identity`, or `browser`.
Each will launch the `git sparse-checkout set` command
to show only the directories needed for those teams.
